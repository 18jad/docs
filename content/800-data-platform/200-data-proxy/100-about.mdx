The Data Proxy provides database connection management and pooling for applications that use Prisma. By using the Data Proxy, your application can seamlessly scale up while maintaining predictable database performance, by limiting the number of total connections used.

The benefits of using the Data Proxy include:

- avoid exhausting the number of database connections or needlessly scaling up your database

- avoid serverless cold starts by reusing existing database connections

- reduced bundle size for frictionless serverless deployments

## About the Data Proxy

Serverless functions are ephemeral and short-lived, so their database connections are numerous and brief.

Because of this, using traditional databases in serverless functions often leads to exhausting the limit of concurrent database connections and increased latencies on each request to establish a database connection.
