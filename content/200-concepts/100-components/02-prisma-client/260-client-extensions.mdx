You can use Prisma Client extensions to add functionality to Prisma Client.

**Note: other docs to update:**

- Client reference - Client methods section - (link to this page)
- Any workarounds that overlap with examples on this page - link here
- Add feature flag to preview features page

We might have a stepped feature release. We might not want to update the preview features page yet. Instead, release this page only as a draft doc. I can, however update the CLient Reference doc, because that will primarily link here, and shouldn't change over the phases of the feature release.

<Admonition type="info">

Prisma Client extensions currently let you extend models. In future Prisma releases, we will add extensibility layers to let you extend results, queries, and Prisma Client itself. **FIND A BETTER WAY TO SUMMARIZE THE LAYERS**

## Considerations and prerequisites

Are there any dependencies you need to install?

### Enable the feature flag in your Prisma schema file

In the generator block of your schema.prisma file, enable the `clientExtensions` feature flag:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["clientExtensions"]
}
```

## Extend a model

You can use Prisma Client extensions to add custom methods and fields a specific model or to all models.

along existing Prisma Client operations (eg. findMany, create, etcâ€¦) to already existing models. These can be new operations, encapsulated business logic, repetitive operations, or even model-specific utilities. model blindly takes an object that contains methods and makes its known properties available on a model.

When you extend a specific model, you can add methods or fields (**is that the right term?**) to a model.

To extend the client, call the [Prisma Client method](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#client-methods) `$extends`.

To extend a specific model:

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  name?: '<name>',
  model?: {
    user: { ... }
  },
});
```

`name` is an optional field. You can use it to give a name to the extension. This name will appear in error logs, tracing, ?metrics?).

To extend all models:

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  name?: '<name>',
  model?: {
   $allModels: { ... }
   },
 })
```
