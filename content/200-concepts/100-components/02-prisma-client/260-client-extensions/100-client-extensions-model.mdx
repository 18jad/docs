This page is in draft for Prisma version 4.6.0.

</Admonition>

From version **TBD**, you can use `model` [Prisma Client extensions](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions) to add custom methods to your models.

To create Prisma Client extensions, use the [`$extends`](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions#about-prisma-client-extensions) client-level method. To add custom methods to your models, use the `model` extension type.

Possible uses include the following:

- New operations to operate alongside existing Prisma Client operations, such as `findMany`
- Encapsulated business logic
- Repetitive operations
- Model-specific utilities

You can add methods to a specific model in your schema or to all models in your schema.

To create Prisma Client extensions, use the [`$extends`](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions#about-prisma-client-extensions) client-level method. To add custom methods to your models, use the `model` extension type.

## Add the <inlinecode>clientExtensions</inlinecode> feature flag to <inlinecode>schema.prisma</inlinecode>

Before you create Prisma Client extensions, you must enable the `clientExtensions` feature flag in the generator block of your `schema.prisma` file, as follows:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["clientExtensions"]
}
```

## Add a custom method to a specific model

To extend a specific model in your schema, use the following structure to add a method to the `user` model:

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  name?: '<name>',
  model?: {
    user: { ... }
  },
});
```

- `name` is an optional field that you can use to name the extension. This name appears in error logs and tracing.

The following example adds a method called `signUp` to the `user` model. This method creates a new user with the specified email address.

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  model: {
    user: {
      async signUp(email: string) {
        await prisma.user.create(...)
      },
    },
  }
})
```

You would call `signUp` in your application as follows:

```ts
const user = await xprisma.user.signUp('john@prisma.io')
```

## Add a custom method to all models in your schema

To extend all models in your schema, use the following structure:

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  name?: '<name>',
  model?: {
    $allModels: { ... }
  },
})
```

- `name` is an optional field that you can use to name the extension. This name appears in error logs and tracing.

The following example adds a `getClass` method to all models.

```ts
const xprisma = new prisma.$extends({
  model: {
    $allModels: {
      getClass<T extends object>(this: T): new () => T {
        return class {
          /** Generic Implementation */
        } as any
      },
    },
  },
})

class UserService extends xprisma.user.getClass() {
  method() {
    const user = this.findFirst({}) // fully type-safe
  }
}
```

You would call `signUp` in your application as follows:

** !!! is the following syntax correct? **

```ts
xprisma.user.getClass() // call the method on xprisma.user
xprisma.post.getClass() // call the method on xprisma.post
```
