This page is in draft for Prisma version 4.6.0. We plan to publish this page for version 4.7.0.

</Admonition>

From version 4.7.0, you can use [Prisma client extensions](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions) to add custom methods to your models. Possible uses include the following:

- New operations to operate alongside existing Prisma Client operations, such as `findMany`
- Encapsulated business logic
- Repetitive operations
- Model-specific utilities

You can add methods as follows to a specific model in your schema or to all models in your schema.

## Add the <inlinecode>clientExtensions</inlinecode> feature flag

Before you add a custom model, you must enable the `clientExtensions` feature flag in the generator block of your `schema.prisma` file, as follows:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["clientExtensions"]
}
```

## Add a custom method to a specific model

To extend a specific model, use the following structure:

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  name?: '<name>',
  model?: {
    user: { ... }
  },
});
```

`name` is an optional field that you can use to name the extension. This name will appear in error logs and tracing.

In the following example, we add a `signUp` method to the `User` model. This method can handle user creation and account logic.

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  model: {
    user: {
      async signUp(email: string) {
        await prisma.user.create(...)
      },
    },
  }
})
```

You can call `signUp` in your application as follows:

```ts
const user = await xprisma.user.signUp('john@prisma.io')
```

## Add a custom method to all models in your schema

To extend all models in your schema, use the following structure:

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  name?: '<name>',
  model?: {
    $allModels: { ... }
  },
})
```

In the following example, we add a `getClass` method to all models.

```ts
const xprisma = new prisma.$extends({
  model: {
    $allModels: {
      getClass<T extends object>(this: T): new () => T {
        return class {
          /** Generic Implementation */
        } as any
      },
    },
  },
})
```

```ts
class UserService extends xprisma.user.getClass() {
  method() {
    const user = this.findFirst({}) // fully type-safe
  }
}
```
