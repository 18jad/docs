Use Prisma Client extensions to add functionality to the models in your schema, result objects, queries, or Prisma Client itself.

There are four types of extension. You can use each type to customize a different aspect of Prisma Client.

- `model` extensions: [add custom methods or fields to your models](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/client-extensions-model)
- `client` extensions: [add client-level methods to Prisma Client](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/client-extensions-client)
- `result` extensions (for future release): [add custom results objects to Prisma Client](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/client-extensions-result)
- `query` extensions (for future release): [create custom Prisma Client queries](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/client-extensions-query)

## About Prisma Client extensions

To create Prisma Client extensions, use the `$extends` [client-level method](/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#client-methods), and the appropriate extension type (`model`, `client`, `result` or `query`).

You can use [multiple independent extensions at the same time](#multiple-extensions), each in is own isolated instance of Prisma Client.

You can also [share your Prisma Client extensions](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/shared-extensions) with other Prisma users, and [import Prisma Client extensions developed by other users](#install-a-packaged-extension) into your Prisma project.

## Prerequisites

To use Prisma Client extensions, you must enable the `clientExtensions` preview feature flag in the `generator` block of your `schema.prisma` file, as follows:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["clientExtensions"]
}
```

## Multiple extensions

Each time that you call `$extends`, you create an _extended client_. This extended client is a forked state of the standard Prisma Client. The original client does not change.

Every extended client operates independently, in an isolated instance. It cannot conflict with other extended clients or the original client.

You can also combine two or more extensions into one extension, if you want the functionality from both extensions to apply in the same client instance. Note that it is possible for [combined extensions to conflict](#conflicts-in-combined-extensions).

### Examples of isolated client instances

Example uses of isolated client instances include the following:

- Implement row-level security (RLS), where each http request has its own client with its own RLS extension, customized with session data. This can keep each user entirely separate, each in a separate client.
- Add a `user.current()` method for the `user` model to get the current logged-in user
- Enable more verbose logging for requests if a debug cookie is set
- Attach a unique request id to all logs so you can correlate them later
- Remove a `delete` method from models unless the application calls the admin endpoint and the user has the necessary priviliges

### Declare multiple extensions

The following example declares two separate extensions and one combined extension:

```ts
// First of all, store your original prisma client in a variable as usual
const prisma = new PrismaClient()

// Declare extension A
const extendsA = prisma.$extends(extensionA)

// Declare extension B
const extendsB = prisma.$extends(extensionB)

// Declare an extension that is a combination of A and B
const extendsAB = prisma.$extends(extensionA).$extends(extensionB)
```

### Conflicts in combined extensions

When you combine two or more extensions, then the last extension that you declare takes precedence in any conflict. In the example above, suppose there is a method called `getName` in `extendsA` and a method called `getName` in `extendsB`. When you call `extendsAB.getName`, then the client uses `getName` as defined in `extendsB`.

## Extensions versus middlewares

Extensions differ from [middlewares](/concepts/components/prisma-client/middleware#performance-and-appropriate-use-cases) in the following ways:

- If you use two or more middlewares at the same time, then they all apply globally to the same client
- Extensions are isolated: the functionality in each one is separate, unless you deliberately combine them
- All extended clients share the same connection pool, but their functionality is separate
- In the RLS example given above, with extensions each user can be in an entirely separate client. With middlewares, all users are active in the same client.
