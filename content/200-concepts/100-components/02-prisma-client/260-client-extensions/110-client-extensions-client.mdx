This page is in draft for Prisma version 4.6.0.

</Admonition>

From version **TBD**, you can use `client` [Prisma Client extensions](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions) to add top-level methods to Prisma Client.

To create Prisma Client extensions, use the [`$extends`](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions#about-prisma-client-extensions) client-level method. To extend Prisma Client, use the `client` extension type.

## Add the <inlinecode>clientExtensions</inlinecode> feature flag to <inlinecode>schema.prisma</inlinecode>

Before you create Prisma Client extensions, you must enable the `clientExtensions` feature flag in the generator block of your `schema.prisma` file, as follows:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["clientExtensions"]
}
```

## Extend Prisma Client

Use the `client` extension type to customize Prisma client.

To add methods to Prisma Client, use the following structure:

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  client?: { ... }
})
```

- `client`: An optional field that adds a top-level method to the client

The following example uses a `client` extension to start an [interactive transaction](/concepts/components/prisma-client/transactions#interactive-transactions-in-preview) without callbacks.

** !!! need clarification on what we mean here by callback **
** !!! interactive transaction works with returned data from the database and can react to it - e.g. check a returned value) - need to make that clear here !!! **

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  client: {
    method(args:) { ... }, // the interactive transaction code goes inside the curly braces
  }
})

xprisma.$method
```

The following code then starts an interactive transaction without the traditional callback:

```ts

const tx = await xprisma.$begin()

await tx.user.create(...)
await tx.user.update(...)

await tx.$commit()

```
