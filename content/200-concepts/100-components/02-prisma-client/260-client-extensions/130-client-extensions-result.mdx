** IMPORTANT: `result` extensions are not currently available. This page is a draft doc for a feature that we plan to release in a future Prisma version. **

</Admonition>

From version **TBD**, you can use `result` [Prisma Client extensions](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions) to add custom results objects to Prisma Client.

To create Prisma Client extensions, use the [`$extends`](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions#about-prisma-client-extensions) client-level method. To add custom results objects, use the `results` extension type.

</TopBlock>

## Add the <inlinecode>clientExtensions</inlinecode> feature flag to <inlinecode>schema.prisma</inlinecode>

Before you create Prisma Client extensions, you must enable the `clientExtensions` feature flag in the generator block of your `schema.prisma` file, as follows:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["clientExtensions"]
}
```

## Add custom results objects to Prisma Client

To add a custom field or method to query results, use the following structure. In this example, we extend query results in the `user` model.

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  result?: {
    user: {        // in this case, we extend query results in the user model
      needs: {..}
    fields: { .. }
      return { .. }
    },
  },
});
```

- `result`: an optional field that defines new fields and methods to the query results
- `needs`: a required object which describes the dependencies of the result field
- `fields`: a required object that contains methods which defines how the virtual field is computed when it is accessed. You must declare equivelant objects in `fields` to the objects that you declare in `needs`.
- `return`: the value of the computed field

### Add a custom field to query results

You can use the `result` extension type to add fields to query results. These fields are computed at runtime and are type-safe.

The following example adds a new, virtual field called `fullName` to the `user` model. It declares the dependencies and the computation logic for `fullname`.

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  result: {
    user: {
      needs: {
        fullName: { firstName: true, lastName: true },
      },
      fields: {
        fullName(user) {
          return `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}` // the value and type that will be available on the result (in this case, the type is string)
        },
      },
    },
  },
})

const user = await xprisma.user.findFirst()
console.log(user.fullName) // returns the user's full name, such as "John Doe"
```

In the above example, the input `user` is automatically typed according to object defined in `needs`. `firstName` and `lastName` are of type `string`, because they are specified in `needs`. If they are not specified in `needs`, then their type is `string | undefined`.

<Admonition type = "info">

When you call a method in your extension, you must use the correct instance in your code. In the above example, `xprisma.user.findFirst` works, but `prisma.user.findFirst` does not.

#### Considerations for fields

- For performance reasons, Prisma Client computes results when your application accesses them at runtime, not on retrieval.
- You can only create fields that are based on scalar fields.
- `result` extensions don't over-fetch. Prisma Client only computes a field if its dependencies are present. In the following example, `undefined` is returned for `fullName` if the user's `email` is undefined.
  ```ts
  const user = await xprisma.user.findFirst({ select: { email: true }))
  console.log(user.fullName) // undefined
  ```

### Add a custom method to the results object

You can use the `result` extension type to add fields to query results. The following example adds a new method, `getAccountBalance` to the results object.

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  result: {
    user: {
      needs: {
        getAccountBalance: {
          account: true,
        },
      },
      fields: {
        getAccountBalance: (user) => (n: number) => {
          return user.account.balance + n
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
const result = await xprisma.user.findFirst()
console.log(result?.getAccountBalance(-500)) // 7245
