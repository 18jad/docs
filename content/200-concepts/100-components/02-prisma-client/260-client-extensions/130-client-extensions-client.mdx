This page is in draft for Prisma version 4.6.0. We plan to publish this page for version 4.7.0.

You can use [Prisma client extensions](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions) to add top-level methods to Prisma Client.

## Extend Prisma Client

<Admonition type="info">

Before you customize Prisma Client with extensions, you must satisfy the [prerequisites for client extensions](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions#prerequisites).

</Admonition>

You can use `$client` to allow top-level customization of Prisma client. It works in the same way as `model` extensions, except that they are not bound to any specific model and you must always call them with a `$` prefix to prevent conflicts with model names.

Example use case for `$client`:

- [Customized interactive transactions](#customized-interactive-transactions)

** IS this the same as the example use case below? **

An example use case is to start an interactive transaction without callbacks, as follows:

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
  client: {
    method(args:) { ... }, // the code goes inside the curly braces
  }
})

xprisma.$method
```

Now we can start an interactive transaction omitting the traditional callback:

```ts

const tx = await xprisma.$begin()

await tx.user.create(...)
await tx.user.update(...)

await tx.$commit()

```

## Example use cases

### Customized interactive transactions

**Uses client**

One use-case for using interactive transactions is testing. Testing with a database can be difficult for a few reasons like needing to clean the data after each test, or having to create an isolated database for each test. With interactive transactions, database mutations can be performed and rolled back at the end the test, almost out of the box. However, this is not possible because iTX is designed (for good reasons) to be used via a callback.

```ts
const xprisma = prisma.$extends({
	client: {
		begin() { ... }, // the code I shared in that issue
	}
})

const tx = await xprisma.$begin()

await tx.user.create(...)
await tx.user.update(...)

await tx.$commit()
```
