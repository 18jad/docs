# Full-Text Search

The Prisma Client supports a full-text search API for Postgres databases. With full-text search enabled, you can add search functionality to your application by searching for text within a database column.

<Admonition type="info">
**Note**: Full text search can **only** be used in a Postgres database
</Admonition>

The Full-Text Search API is still in **Preview**. You can enable `fullTextSearch` in your Prisma Schema:

```jsx
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["fullTextSearch"]
}

model Post {
	id     Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  title  String @unique
  body   String
  status Status
}

enum Status {
  Draft
  Live
}
```

After your regenerate your client, you'll see a new `search` field on your `String` fields that you can query on. Here's a few examples:

```jsx
// All posts that contain the words cat or dog.
const result = await prisma.posts.findMany({
  where: {
    body: {
      search: 'cat | dog',
    },
  },
})

// All drafts that contain the words cat and dog.
const result = await prisma.posts.findMany({
  where: {
    status: 'Draft',
    body: {
      search: 'cat & dog',
    },
  },
})
```

## Query Format

The `search` field uses the database's native querying capabilities under the hood. This means that the Prisma Client supports what the databases support.

To get a sense of how the query format works, consider the following text:

**"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"**

Here's how the following queries would match that text:

| Query          | Match? | Description                         |
| :------------- | :----- | :---------------------------------- |
| fox & dog      | true   | The text contains fox and dog       |
| dog & fox      | true   | The text contains dog and fox       |
| dog & cat      | false  | The text doesn't contain cat        |
| fox &#124; cat | true   | The text contains fox or cat        |
| cat &#124; pig | false  | The text doesn't contain cat or pig |
| fox <-> dog    | true   | dog follows fox in the text         |
| dog <-> fox    | false  | dog doesn't follow fox in the text  |

## Adding Indexes

To speed up your full-text queries, you should add an index to your database.
Prisma Migrate currently doesn't support adding search indices, but you can
easily add one yourself.

```sql
CREATE INDEX post_body_index ON posts USING GIN (body);
```

You can continue using Prisma Migrate as you were before, it will ignore indexes
that it doesn't know about.

## Limitations

- The `search` field is only supported in PostgreSQL
- You'll need to manage indexes yourself.
