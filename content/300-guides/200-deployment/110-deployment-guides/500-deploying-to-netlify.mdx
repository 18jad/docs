In this guide, you will set up and deploy a serverless Node.js application to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The application will expose a REST API and use Prisma Client to handle fetching, creating, and deleting records from a database.

Netlify is a cloud platform for continuous deployment, static sites, and serverless functions. Netlify integrates seamlessly with GitHub for automatic deployments upon commits. In this guide, you will use this approach to create a CI/CD pipeline that deploys your application from a GitHub repository.

The application has the following components:

- **Backend**: Serverless Node.js REST API with resource endpoints that use Prisma Client to handle database operations against a PostgreSQL database (e.g. hosted on Heroku).
- **Frontend**: Static HTML page to interact with the API.

![architecture diagram](https://res.cloudinary.com/prismaio/image/upload/v1628765080/docs/ybRH5wH_bpimat.png)

The focus of this guide is to show how Prisma integrates with Netlify. The starting point is the [Prisma Netlify example](https://github.com/prisma/deployment-example-netlify) which has a couple of REST endpoints preconfigured as serverless functions and a static HTML page.

With Netlify, the fundamental building block is a [**Site**](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/). Sites are typically connected to a Git repository and have a publicly accessible URL that looks like `https://site-name.netlify.app`. In this guide, you will connect a GitHub repository to a Netlify site.

> Throughout the guide you'll find various **checkpoints** that you can use to validate if you performed the steps correctly.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Hosted PostgreSQL database and a URL from which it can be accessed, e.g. `postgresql://username:password@your_postgres_db.cloud.com/db_identifier` (you can use Heroku, which offers a [free plan](https://dev.to/prisma/how-to-setup-a-free-postgresql-database-on-heroku-1dc1)).
- [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/signup) account connected to your GitHub account (Netlify will need access to the repository you will create as part of this guide).
- [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) installed.
- Node.js installed.

## Prisma workflow

Prisma supports different workflows depending on whether you integrate with an existing database or create a new one from scratch. Regardless of the workflow, Prisma relies on the Prisma schema - that is, the `schema.prisma` file.

This guide starts with an empty database that you must have already created and looks as follows:

1. Map the existing database schema to your existing database using `prisma migrate dev`.
2. Run `prisma generate` to generate the Prisma Client based on the Prisma schema.

## 1. Fork the `deployment-example-netlify` repository

Go to [`deployment-example-netlify`](https://github.com/prisma/deployment-example-netlify) and fork the repository by clicking the **Fork** button in the top-right corner:

![fork button](https://res.cloudinary.com/prismaio/image/upload/v1628765101/docs/nyap5pW_g0tbuw.png)

By forking, you create a copy of the repository to which you will be able to commit your changes. Later in the guide, you will connect the forked repository to Netlify so that changes are automatically built and deployed.

**Checkpoint:** After you complete the forking, you should see the forked repository in your account, for example `https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/deployment-example-netlify`

## 2. Clone the fork and install dependencies

Open your terminal, navigate to a location of your choice and clone your fork of the `deployment-example-netlify`:

```terminal
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/deployment-example-netlify.git
```

After cloning the repository, install the dependencies:

```terminal
cd deployment-example-netlify
npm install
```

**Checkpoint:** `ls -1` should show:

```terminal
ls -1
README.md
functions/
netlify.toml
node_modules/
package.json
prisma/
public/
```

## 3. Get the Heroku PostgreSQL connection string

You need the Heroku PostgreSQL connection string to define the necessary Prisma connection variable.

1. In Heroku, open your app and select the **Resources** tab.
2. Click the **Heroku Postgres** database add-on.
3. Select the **Settings** tab in the page of the Heroku Postgres add-on.
4. Click **View Credentials**.
5. From the **URI** field, copy the entire connection string.

**Checkpoint:** The Heroku connection string has the following format:

```
postgres://__USER__:__PASSWORD__@__HOST__/__DATABASE__
```

When you next set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, you need to change the beginning string from `postgres` to `postgresql`.

## 4. Set the DATABASE_URL environment variable locally

Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable locally. The `prisma.schema` file uses this variable so that Prisma can access the database to introspect:

```terminal
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://__USER__:__PASSWORD__@__HOST__/__DATABASE__"
```

> **Note:** You need the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable for the subsequent steps. Set it in all terminal sessions related to this project.

You need to replace the uppercase placeholders with your database credentials, e.g.:

```terminal
postgresql://janedoe:randompassword@yourpostgres.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/yourdbname
```

Or simply copy and paste the connection string you get from your cloud database provider.

## 5. Create a shadow database in your cloud provider and get the connection string

In the later stages of this guide, you will run the `prisma migrate dev --name init` command to map the data model (that is pre-defined for this project in the `schema.prisma` file) to the database. As you develop your app, you continuously need to run `prisma migrate dev` whenever you make a change to `schema.prisma` so that the changes are migrated to the database.

This is part of the development cycle of your app and for all such operations Prisma requires the availability of a [shadow database](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/shadow-database).

Cloud database providers do not allow the automated creation of a shadow database. To enable a shadow database, you need to create a new database manually in your provider.

After you create a new database, get its connection string.

## 4. Set the SHADOW_DATABASE_URL environment variable locally

Set the `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL` environment variable locally for the shadow database.

```terminal
export SHADOW_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://__USER__:__PASSWORD__@__HOST__/__DATABASE__"
```

> **Note:** You need the `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL` environment variable for the subsequent steps. Set it in all terminal sessions related to this project.

Again, replace the uppercase placeholders with your database credentials, like so:

```terminal
postgresql://janedoe:randompassword@yourpostgres.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/yourdbname
```

Or simply copy and paste the connection string you get from your cloud database provider.

## 5. Add the `shadowDatabaseUrl` parameter to `schema.prisma`

To enable the use of the shadow database, you must also add the `shadowDatabaseUrl` parameter to the `schema.prisma` file in the `database db` section.

```prisma highlight=4;normal
datasource db {
  provider          = "postgresql"
  url               = env("DATABASE_URL")
  shadowDatabaseUrl = env("SHADOW_DATABASE_URL")
}
```

## 6. Migrate the Prisma schema to the database

The `prisma/schema.prisma` file contains a pre-defined model for the app. It defines the `Post`, `Profile`, and `User` models which the `prisma migrate` command uses to create the database tables and relationships.

```terminal
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

## 7. Netlify login

Make sure you're logged in to Netlify with the CLI:

```terminal
netlify login
```

This will allow you to create a Netlify site and connect it to a repository from the terminal.

**Checkpoint:** `netlify status` should show your username:

```terminal
netlify status
──────────────────────┐
 Current Netlify User │
──────────────────────┘
Name: your name
Email: your@email.com
Teams:
  ....
```

## 8. Configure continuous deployment to Netlify

From the repository's folder, run `netlify init` to configure a new Netlify site:

![Running netlify init to configure a new Netlify site](https://res.cloudinary.com/prismaio/image/upload/v1628765126/docs/Ctt56FN_oyu0dq.png)

You will be prompted with configuration options:

1. Select `Create & configure a new site`
2. If prompted to select your team, pick the one in which Netlify will create the site
3. Give the site a unique name
4. _Your build command_: `npm run build`
5. _Directory to deploy_: `public`

**Checkpoint:** The Netlify CLI should output the following:

```text
Site Created

Admin URL: https://app.netlify.com/sites/YOUR_SITE_NAME
URL:       https://YOUR_SITE_NAME.netlify.app
```

> **Note:** You can change the build configuration via the `netlify.toml` file and the site name from the Netlify admin UI.

## 9. Expose the DATABASE_URL environment variable to functions

Since Prisma will connect to the database from your serverless functions, you need to expose the `DATABASE_URL` to the backend functions. This is typically done from the Netlify UI. To do, open the Netlify admin UI for the site. You can do so directly with the Netlify CLI as follows:

```terminal
netlify open --admin
```

Once open, go to **Site settings**:

![Netlify admin UI](https://res.cloudinary.com/prismaio/image/upload/v1628765152/docs/p472v73_amyavf.png)

Navigate to **Build & deploy** in the sidebar on the left and then select **Environment**:

![Netlify environment variables](https://res.cloudinary.com/prismaio/image/upload/v1628765166/docs/UJc23f8_jfpxmf.png)

Create a variable with the key `DATABASE_URL` and set the value with your PostgresSQL URL.

> **Note:** It's considered best practice to keep secrets out of your codebase. If you open up the `prisma/schema.prisma` file, you should see `env("DATABASE_URL")` in the _datasource_ block. By setting an environment variable you keep secrets out of the codebase.

## 10. Deploy the app

Your project is now ready for deployment

You can now use `git push` to push the commit with the Prisma schema. This will trigger a netlify build.

**Checkpoint:** Call the API status endpoint:

```terminal
curl https://YOUR_SITE_NAME.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/status
```

The call should return: `{"up":true}`

## 11. Test your deployed application

Open the site from the command line:

```terminal
netlify open:site
```

This will open the static frontend that you deployed.
The URL should like this: `https://YOUR_SITE_NAME.netlify.app`.

![deployed-screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/prismaio/image/upload/v1628765208/docs/RnaHMS3_urf3iu.png)

The four buttons allow you to make requests to the REST API and view the response:

- **Check API status**: Will call the REST API status endpoint that returns `{"up":true}`. The implementation code is in `functions/index.js`
- **Seed data**: Will delete all database records and load the database with test data `users`, `profiles`, and `posts`. Returns the created users. The implementation code is in `functions/seed.js`
- **Load users with profiles**: Will load all `users` in the database with their related `profiles`. The implementation code is in `functions/getUsers.js`
- **Load Posts**: Will load `posts` and their related `authors`. The implementation code is in `functions/getPosts.js`

For example, calling seed data should show the following:

![deployed-screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/prismaio/image/upload/v1628765199/docs/dOJUBsv_e6fx9m.png)

## Summary

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed the application to Netlify.

For more insight into Prisma Client's API, look at the function handlers in the `functions/` folder.

Generally, when using a FaaS (function as a service) environment to interact with a database, it's beneficial to pool DB connections for performance reasons. This is because every function invocation may result in a new connection to the database (this is not a problem with a constantly running node.js server). For more information on some of the solutions, refer to the [connection management guide for serverless environments](/guides/performance-and-optimization/connection-management#serverless-environments-faas).
